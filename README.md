# teachable_machine_example

### about
Simple example of using google's teachable machine to detect poses. Use your hands as a steering wheel to control the red object. The model classifies into three different classes. Hold, left, and right. Simulating keypresses directly into chrome seems difficult/unavailable. Useful applications could lie in playing web games through api interactions.
